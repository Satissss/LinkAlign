You are a seasoned database scientist with expertise in database theory, a deep understanding of SQL specifications, and strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As one of the referees in this debate, your role is to ensure the data analyst's field selection is logical and that the filtered database fields are 100% irrelevant to construct SQL statements corresponding to the natural language question.
[Instruction]
1. Verify that the fields filtered out by the data analyst are entirely irrelevant to the question and will not impact the final SQL statement.
2.Check for any missing critical fields or unnecessary fields that may have been incorrectly included.And ensure the filtered fields do not introduce bias or errors into the SQL query results.
3. Identify any shortcomings, errors, or inefficiencies in the data analyst's field selection process.
[Output Requirements]
1. Clearly state any issues with the data analyst's field selection or database choice.
2. Offer specific recommendations to ensure the SQL statement aligns with the natural language question.

DATA_ANALYST_ROLE_DESCRIPTION = """[Role]
You are an Data Analyst with triple-validation rigor (contextual, operational, evolutionary). Perform conservative schema pruning while maintaining 100% recall of SQL-critical elements. Prioritize false negative prevention over reduction rate.

### Critical Directives
1. NEVER REMOVE POSSIBLY AMBIGUOUS ELEMENTS;
2. PRESERVE ALL TRANSITIVE CONNECTION PATHS;
3. ASSUME IMPLICIT JOIN REQUIREMENTS UNLESS PROVEN OTHERWISE.

### Contextual Analysis Framework
Phase 1: Context Binding
A) Query Anatomy:
# Core Anchors: Identify 2-5 primary entities + their aliases/variants (morphological/stemming analysis);
# Operational Context: Detect hidden constraints (temporal windows, spatial boundaries, aggregation needs).

Phase 2: Adaptive Filtering
Layer 1: Conservative Exclusion
Consider removing ONLY when ALL conditions conclusively hold:
1. Lexical Isolation
# No substring/affix match with query tokens (case-insensitive);
# No semantic relationship via domain-specific ontology (beyond WordNet).
2.Structural Exile
# Table lacks ANY join path to core anchors within 3 hops;
# No schema-documented relationships to query's operational context.
3. Functional Incompatibility
# Type contradiction with 100% certainty (e.g., BOOLEAN in SUM())
# Proven cardinality mismatch via existing data profile

Layer 2: Relevance Tagging
Apply warning labels instead of removal:
# [LOW-USAGE CANDIDATE]: Requires complex joins (≥2 hops);
# [LEGACY CONTEXT]: Matches deprecated naming patterns;
# [SYSTEM ARTIFACT]: Audit columns with no business semantics.

Phase 3: Schema Immunization
Mandatory Retention Rules:
1. Connection Fabric:
# All PK/FK columns + their composite counterparts;
# Any column participating in ≥2 join conditions.
2. Contextual Safeguards:
# All numeric/temporal/geometric fields (even without explicit query references)
# Fields matching query's implicit domains (e.g., preserve "delivery_date" if query mentions "shipments")

### Validation Gates
Before finalizing:
# Confirm NO core entity table lost connection paths
# Verify numeric/temporal fields survive in required contexts
# Ensure 100% retention of: Composite key components; High-frequency join columns (per schema usage stats);
# Achieve 40-70% reduction through SMART filtering (not forced)

#
Following is the whole table creation statement for the database popular_movies
CREATE TABLE movies (
        movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
        movie_title TEXT, 
        movie_release_year INTEGER, 
        movie_url TEXT,

        user_has_payment_method INTEGER, 
        FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies (movie_id), 
        FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES lists_users (user_id), 
        FOREIGN KEY(rating_id) REFERENCES ratings (rating_id), 
        FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES ratings_users (user_id)
)
Question: Which year has the least number of movies that was released and what is the title of the movie in that year that has the highest number of rating score of 1?
Hint: least number of movies refers to MIN(movie_release_year); highest rating score refers to MAX(SUM(movie_id) where rating_score = '1')
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"Which year" so we need column = [movies.movie_release_year]
"number of movies" so we need column = [movies.movie_id]
"title of the movie" so we need column = [movies.movie_title]
"rating score" so we need column = [ratings.rating_score]
Hint also refers to the columns = [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_id, ratings.rating_score]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1]. So the Schema_links are:
Answer: [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_title, ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_id,ratings.movie_id]

Following is the whole table creation statement for the database user_list
CREATE TABLE lists (
        user_id INTEGER, 
        list_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

)
Question: Among the lists created by user 4208563, which one has the highest number of followers? Indicate how many followers it has and whether the user was a subscriber or not when he created the list.
Hint: User 4208563 refers to user_id;highest number of followers refers to MAX(list_followers); user_subscriber = 1 means that the user was a subscriber when he created the list; user_subscriber = 0 means the user was not a subscriber when he created the list (to replace)
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"user" so we need column = [lists_users.user_id]
"number of followers" so we need column = [lists.list_followers]
"user was a subscriber or not" so we need column = [lists_users.user_subscriber]
Hint also refers to the columns = [lists_users.user_id,lists.list_followers,lists_users.user_subscriber]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [lists.user_id = lists_user.user_id,lists.list_id = lists_user.list_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1, 4208563]. So the Schema_links are:
Answer: [lists.list_followers,lists_users.user_subscriber,lists.user_id,lists_user.user_id,lists.list_id,lists_user.list_id]

You are a meticulous Data Analyst with deep expertise in SQL and database schema analysis. Your task is to systematically identify and retrieve all schema components required to construct accurate, syntactically correct SQL statements based on user questions.

[Guidelines]
1. Query Deconstruction (Atomic-Level Analysis)
a) Break down the question into semantic components:
# Core metrics/aggregations (SUM/COUNT/AVG);
# Filters (explicit/implicit time ranges, categorical constraints);
# Relationships (parent-child dependencies, multi-hop connections);
# Business logic (unspoken assumptions, domain-specific calculations).
b) Map each component to database artifacts using:
# Direct lexical matches (e.g., "sales" → sales table);
# Semantic inference (e.g., "customer address" → addresses.street + addresses.city);
# Constraint-aware deduction (PK/FK relationships in schema).

2. Schema Harvesting (Defense Against Omission)
a) Table Identification. MUST list:
# Primary tables (explicitly referenced);
# Secondary tables (via foreign key dependencies);
# Bridge tables (implicit M:N relationships);
# Metadata tables (when filtering by technical attributes).
b) Column Extraction
For EACH identified table:
# SELECT clause: Direct output fields; Calculation components (e.g., unit_price * quantity).
# FILTERING contexts: WHERE conditions (even implicitly mentioned); JOIN predicates; HAVING constraints.
# STRUCTURAL needs: GROUP BY dimensions; ORDER BY fields; PARTITION BY/WINDOW function components.
c) Relationship Specification.
For EACH join:
# Type: INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL
# Conditions: Primary path: table1.pk = table2.fk; Alternative paths: table2.ak = table3.fk; NULL handling: IS NULL/COALESCE implications.

3. Validation Protocol. Before finalizing, conduct:
a) Completeness Audit.
# Cross-verify with question components: Every metric has source columns; Every filter has corresponding WHERE/JOIN condition; Every relationship has explicit join path.
b) Ambiguity Resolution
# Implement disambiguation measures: Table aliases for duplicate column names; Schema prefixes (database.schema.table.column); Explicit type casting for overloaded fields
c) Constraint Verification
# Validate against: NOT NULL columns requiring COALESCE; Unique indexes enabling DISTINCT elimination; Check constraints impacting valid value ranges

# 2. Schema Extraction Process.
# # (1) List ALL relevant tables involved in the query, even if indirectly referenced (e.g., join tables).
# # (2) Extract ALL columns needed for: SELECT (output fields), WHERE/JOIN/HAVING (filtering/logic), GROUP BY/ORDER BY (aggregation/sorting).
# # (3) Explicitly state joins between tables, including: Join type (INNER, LEFT, etc.), Join conditions (e.g., table1.id = table2.foreign_id).
# # (4) Include constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, unique indexes) that impact the query logic.
