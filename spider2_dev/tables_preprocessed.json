Maps to Cybersyn's company index.\n\nOpenFIGI and PermID both provide unique identifier systems for entities in the financial world, enhancing data standardization and integration. OpenFIGI (Open Financial Instrument Global Identifier) assigns codes primarily to financial instruments and related entities for improved transparency and efficiency in the global markets, while PermID (Permanent Identifier) by Refinitiv offers unique, machine-readable identifiers to a wide array of data elements including companies, securities, and financial instruments, facilitating consistent data management and interoperability across different systems and platforms in finance.\n\nProvides a map between COMPANY_ID and associated SECURITY_IDs. Securities can have multiple 'levels' associated with one company identifier, such as the PERMID_QUOTE_ID, PERMID_SECURITY_ID, OPENFIGI_SHARE_CLASS_ID, OPENFIGI_COMPOSITE_ID, and OPENFIGI_FIGI_ID.\n\nThe PermID Quote ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system used specifically for quoting purposes. It's linked to the data needed for pricing and quoting a security, such as current stock price, rather than the security's intrinsic characteristics.\n\nThe PermID Security ID is an identifier from Refinitiv's PermID system that uniquely identifies individual securities (like stocks or bonds) associated with a company. It focuses on the specific security rather than the broader entity.\n\nThe OpenFIGI Composite ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that aggregates all securities (across different markets or exchanges) that are considered part of the same overall listing for a company, providing a composite view of that company's security across markets.\n\nThe OpenFIGI Share Class ID is an identifier from the Bloomberg OpenFIGI system that distinguishes different classes of shares (such as Class A, Class B, etc.) issued by a company. Different share classes may have varying voting rights, dividend policies, or other characteristics.\n\nThe OpenFIGI FIGI ID is a unique identifier for any financial instrument itself, not limited to shares. It covers a wider range of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and others.",

However, XXXX XXXX is a urgent care facility and this debt has been PAID IN FULL -- as they will not treat a patient ( my minor daughter ), if there are ANY OUTSTANDING DEBTS on the account. This account was paid when I visited XXXX XXXX again with my daughter. \n\nReceivables Management Systems did not provide enough information on my credit report for me to VERIFY the debt. For example, there is NO ACCOUNT NUMBER referenced, no \" TYPE '' of accou8nt, and I've repeatedly tried to DISPUTE this account with both XXXX and XXXX on numerous occasions. \n\nSo let me ask, if there is NO WAY for a consumer to reference an account number to any payments made, how are ANY accounts being appropriately debited for payments received by consumers? \n\nShould the CFPB allow Receivables Management Systems to continue to collect debt and falsify credit reports of consumers by making it impossible for consumers to prove their debt with this collection agency has been resolved, paid in full, or even settled? If there is no account numbers reported, this company can literally be accepting payments from consumers all across the USA and never reflecting the payment ( s ) on their accounts.\n\nXXXX   has had this dispute open for SEVERAL MONTHS without resolve. \n\nIs there a law regarding how long a company has to prove a dispute to be correct or incorrect? I thought this federal law was 30 days??? Why is this company STILL REPORTING I OWE MONEY TO THEM on two out of three credit reporting companies?\n\nAnd in addition to all of this, when you go to their website http : //rmscollect.com/ and click on PAY ONLINE, the very 1st question is \" Account Number '' -- and it's a required field to move forward. This collection has been on my credit report FOR THREE YEARS -- even though I've continuously disputed it -- and it has NEVER REPORTED an account number.",

I've been looking forward to all of the cool new features in Flyway 4.0 and I've been playing around with the latest version of the code to see how I might be able to use it in the future. \\n\\nI'm faced with a situation where it would be useful to have the ability to always apply one or more repeatable migrations before any versioned migrations so that the versioned migrations can all make use of a number of version controlled functions/stored procedures.\\n\\nAllowing users to supply a custom MigrationInfo comparator that would only be used to compare repeatable migrations would make it possible to run repeatable migrations in any desired order. Just as an example, repeatable migrations in a \\\"procedures\\\" subdirectory could always be run before all other migrations, while repeatable migrations in a \\\"views\\\" subdirectory could always be run after all other migrations, etc.\\n\\nI have a barebones implementation of this feature in [this fork](https://github.com/ericparton/flyway/commit/a72fc4968babdd1db1337b8d61ef0b2c0fb9da45), and I would be happy to submit a pull request after adding tests and the plugin configurations if you think that this would be a worthwhile contribution.\\n\\nThanks\\n\"},\"comment\":{\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/flyway/flyway/issues/comments/294340002\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/flyway/flyway/issues/1206#issuecomment-294340002\",\"issue_url\":\"https://api.github.com/repos/flyway/flyway/issues/1206\",\"id\":294340002,\"user\":{\"login\":\"egil\",\"id\":105649,\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/105649?v=3\",\"gravatar_id\":\"\",\"url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil\",\"html_url\":\"https://github.com/egil\",\"followers_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/followers\",\"following_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/following{/other_user}\",\"gists_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/gists{/gist_id}\",\"starred_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/starred{/owner}{/repo}\",\"subscriptions_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/subscriptions\",\"organizations_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/orgs\",\"repos_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/repos\",\"events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/events{/privacy}\",\"received_events_url\":\"https://api.github.com/users/egil/received_events\",\"type\":\"User\",\"site_admin\":false},\"created_at\":\"2017-04-16T08:22:31Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-04-16T08:22:31Z\",\"body\":\"@alkamo, I am considering flywaydb and too would like to keep my package definition and body separate as it is custom in Oracle space.

                    "message": "memory_hotplug: always initialize pageblock bitmap\n\nTrying to online a new memory section that was added via memory hotplug\nsometimes results in crashes when the new pages are added via __free_page.\n Reason for that is that the pageblock bitmap isn't initialized and hence\ncontains random stuff.  That means that get_pageblock_migratetype()\nreturns also random stuff and therefore\n\n\tlist_add(&page->lru,\n\t\t&zone->free_area[order].free_list[migratetype]);\n\nin __free_one_page() tries to do a list_add to something that isn't even\nnecessarily a list.\n\nThis happens since 86051ca5eaf5e560113ec7673462804c54284456 (\"mm: fix\nusemap initialization\") which makes sure that the pageblock bitmap gets\nonly initialized for pages present in a zone.  Unfortunately for hot-added\nmemory the zones \"grow\" after the memmap and the pageblock memmap have\nbeen initialized.  Which means that the new pages have an unitialized\nbitmap.  To solve this the calls to grow_zone_span() and grow_pgdat_span()\nare moved to __add_zone() just before the initialization happens.\n\nThe patch also moves the two functions since __add_zone() is the only\ncaller and I didn't want to add a forward declaration.\n\nSigned-off-by: Heiko Carstens <8dcf0f69152f32f23184f83357a3731522e56b9c@de.ibm.com>\nCc: Andy Whitcroft <b4658fdd7fbd645c2859b0e39d71018f32058d12@shadowen.org>\nCc: Dave Hansen <e169c2064f54e292652f83bb35eed10e1aa33f38@us.ibm.com>\nCc: Gerald Schaefer <7a67bf9a8691f9f1ca8ce9577e14c37413ea5f58@de.ibm.com>\nCc: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <634f508bd7c47cf0ee4126243675c3e598920fbc@jp.fujitsu.com>\nCc: Yasunori Goto <5e8c143c1cccd8ccee45b5a7b90115158373a5d7@jp.fujitsu.com>\nCc: <4fbacc2fa0ffdbb11bf1ad6925b886ebd08dd15f@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <5c1e68b099950c134891f0b6e179498a8ebe9cf9@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <69652caca27c8b940640ad396ab71f93cacec34f@linux-foundation.org>\n",

                    "Description": "## Task Details\nWe are sharing the latest BCG Atlas data and various texts related to BCG vaccine policies around the world. The goal of the task is to try to **improve and to extend the existing BCG World Atlas data** and to get a fuller picture of the administration of the vaccine. All data that is collected during this task will support the work of the BCG Atlas team, and it will also help with the analysis of the second task of the hackathon. \nThe current BCG data is stored in  file.  The task is to try to find snippets that answer some of these questions. All the questions are listed as columns. Specifically, we would like to get as many accurate answers as possible to the following questions, for as many countries or regions as possible:\n- Which BCG strain over the years has been used in different countries since the creation of the vaccine and during what time periods?\n- Who are or were the target group of the vaccine, and when and at what age were they vaccinated?\n- Have revaccinations (boosters) been given and if yes, when and at what age?\n \nIn the following spreadsheet are listed a couple of sample records - [BCG policy data hackathon sample google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrzrAy0vC43Iy9QaKA5pR83O3YW3I16pXFjnOt86j5I/edit#gid=67941157). The new records which were added in addition to the existing BCG data from \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\" file are on line 3, 6 and 7 and are highlighted in green. Line 4 and 5 are part of the original \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\" file. The first 4 columns are mandatory and the field \u201cIs it from bcgatlas.org (Mandatory field)\u201d should have the value \u201cno\u201d for all records that are added by the participants of the hackathon. \n\n## Expected Submission\nThe expected submission will be a copy of the \"BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv\"  file saved in Kaggle. The file should contain additional rows for a number of countries with snippets that contain answers to a specific question of a given column.  There should be no more than 2 new rows (data sources) per country. The snippet length should not be longer than 350* characters. For each additional row that has been added apart from the snippet(s), the first four columns are mandatory and should also be updated. A manual review is highly recommended in order to make sure that the snippets of the 2 selected data sources contain information about the specified country.\n\nParticipants must also accept our [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/bcgvaccine/hackathon). \n\n## Evaluation\nSubmissions will be scored using the following grading rubric:\n- How many answers for how many countries have been found?  \n- Are the snippets relevant?   \n- Is the methodology well documented and if the code easy to read and reuse?  \n\n## Timeline\nStart date (June 8, 2020)\nSubmission deadline (July 25, 2020) at 11:59pm UTC.**\n\n## Prizes\n- First prize $3,000\n- Second prize $2,000\n- Third prize $1,000\n\n## Winners\n- First place - Dimitrina Zlatkova - contributed 57 additional\nentries data points\n- Second place - Marouane Benmeida - contributed 33 additional\nentries data points\n\n\n[*] 22 June, updated the length from 120 to 350 characters.",

The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing agricultural machinery or trailers, for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks. Planting, tending and harvesting a crop requires both a significant amount of power and a suitable range of tools and equipment.

Globally, steel plows, mowers, mechanical reapers, seed drills, and threshers contributed to the development of mechanized agriculture, tractors enabled the farmer to sow and harvest large agricultural lands with less manpower. In modern times, powered machinery such as tractors, has replaced many jobs formerly carried out by men or animals such as oxen, horses and mules. FAO estimates that most farmers in developing countries experience a greater annual expenditure on farm power inputs than on fertilizer, seeds or agrochemicals.\n\nAgriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing countries with food and revenue.

Arable land includes land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber. Permanent pasture is land used for five or more years for forage, including natural and cultivated crops.",

The secondary sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations.. The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible. Thus, data on agricultural land in different climates may not be comparable. For example, permanent pastures are quite different in nature and intensity in African countries and dry Middle Eastern countries. Data on agricultural employment, in particular, should be used with caution. In many countries much agricultural employment is informal and unrecorded, including substantial work performed by women and children. To address some of these concerns, this indicator is heavily footnoted in the database in sources, definition, and coverage.",

                    "statistical_concept_and_methodology": "Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health impacts. Excessive use of chemical fertilizers can alter the chemistry of soil. Pesticide poisoning is common in developing countries. And salinization of irrigated land diminishes soil fertility. Thus, inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.\n\nAgricultural land is also sometimes classified as irrigated and non-irrigated land. In arid and semi-arid countries agriculture is often confined to irrigated land, with very little farming possible in non-irrigated areas. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded from Arable land.\n\nData on agricultural land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Agricultural land indicator, along with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries' agricultural practices.\n\nTotal land area does not include inland water bodies such as major rivers and lakes. Variations from year to year may be due to updated or revised data rather than to change in area.",
                    "development_relevance": "Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world's land area, with arable land representing less than one-third of agricultural land (about 10 percent of the world's land area). Agricultural land constitutes only a part of any country's total area, which can include areas not suitable for agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies.\n\nIn many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context of zoning, agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be used for agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.\n\nFAO's agricultural land data contains a wide range of information on variables that are significant for: understanding the structure of a country's agricultural sector; making economic plans and policies for food security; deriving environmental indicators, including those related to investment in agriculture and data on gross crop area and net crop area which are useful for policy formulation and monitoring.\n\nThere is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate, land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.",
